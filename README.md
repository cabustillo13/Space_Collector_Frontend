## 1) IMPLEMENTATION :white_check_mark:

We use **WorldWind:** is an open source virtual globe API. WorldWind allows developers to quickly and easily create interactive visualizations of 3D globe, map and geographical information.

Because WorldWind is completely open source, extending the API is simple and easy to do.

## 2) CODE :raised_hands:

If you do not already have a web server, you can use a minimal development web server built in Node.js:

#### - Download and install Node:
```
Open a command line console in the root folder of your web app (where the ‘index.html’ file and your ‘./images’ folder is located).
In the command line console, run npm install http-server.
Execute the command http-server to start the server.
In your web browsear, head to the address http://localhost/:8080.
Another option is to use Python’s http.server:
```
#### - Download and install Python version 3.X.
```
Open a command line console in the root folder of your web app (where the ‘index.html’ file and your ‘./images’ folder is located).
In the command line console, run python -m http.server.
In your web browser, head to the address http://localhost/:8000.
```
